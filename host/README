1. Configure the hypervisor absolute path by environment variable
   a) export HV_ROOTDIR = /xxxx/acrn-ebtool/acrn-hypervisor/hypervisor

   b) or add this variable in  ~/.bashrc
   HV_ROOTDIR = "/xxxx/acrn-ebtool/acrn-hypervisor/hypervisor"

   source ~/.bashrc

2. build for mrb
   cd acrn-unit-test/host
   ## it will copy acrn.* from host/build to acrn_ebtool/out
   make boot-bin or hw-bin or vp-base-bin ...
   cd acrn-ebtool
   make sos_boot
   make flash_acrn

3. build for nuc
   cd acrn-unit-test/host
   make defconfig BOARD=nuc7i7bnh
   make menuconfig
	Set ACRN Scenario as “Logical Partition VMs”;
        Set Maximum number of VCPUs per VM as “2”;
        Set Maximum number of PCPU as “4”;
        Clear/Disable “Enable hypervisor relocation”.

   ## it will copy acrn.* from host/build to acrn_ebtool/out
   make boot-bin or hw-bin or vp-base-bin BOARD=nuc7i7bnh ...

   Copy acrn.32.out to a removable disk.
   Plug in the removable disk into the NUC’s USB port.
   Copy the acrn.32.out from removable disk to /boot directory.
